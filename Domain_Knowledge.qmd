According to wikipedia, 

> *Domain knowledge is knowledge of a specific, specialized discipline or field, in contrast to general (or domain-independent) knowledge. The term is often used in reference to a more general disciplineâ€”for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry. People with domain knowledge are often regarded as specialists or experts in their field.* [1]

The definition I like is:

> *"In Datascience the term domain knowledge is used to refer to the general background knowledge of the field or environment to which the methods of data science are being applied."*
