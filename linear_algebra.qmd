**Mathematical Foundations**

Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entites like x. I.E. $2*x + 5 = 25$

Linear algebra was developed to solve linear equations. "Solving for unknowns within a system of linear equations". If there is a non-linear transformation it doesn't fall within this definition. It can provide study for  objects such as lines, planes and hyperplanes. It can be traced back to ancient civilizations. 

Tensors are a machine learning generalization of vectors and matricies to any number of dimensions. I.E. An extra dimension for the number of observations in the MNIST dataset.
